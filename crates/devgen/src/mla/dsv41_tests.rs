//! V4.1's tensor binding, against the released shards.
//!
//! The binding is where this checkpoint is most likely to go wrong, because the optional per-layer
//! groups are DERIVED rather than stated: `kv_source_layer_ids` gives a compressor,
//! `index_source_layer_ids` gives indexer queries, and only the intersection gives indexer KEYS.
//! Each derivation is a place to read V4.1 as V4, and a misread binds the wrong tensors instead of
//! failing — the loader's answer to a name it cannot find has historically been a zero fill.
//!
//! So this asserts the declared `(name, bytes)` list reproduces what is actually on disk, for
//! every one of the 40 layers, both directions: nothing declared that the shards do not have, and
//! nothing in the shards that the declaration misses.
