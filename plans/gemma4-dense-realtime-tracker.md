# Gemma-4-12B dense realtime tracker

Updated: 2026-09-17
Branch: `gemma4-12b-mi300x-vllm-rungs-v2`
Checkpoint: `google/gemma-4-12B-it` rev `707f0a3b8a3c7ad586ed01e27eafbad8a27dd0f7`
Plan: "Dense throughput — missing fused kernels + tile-specific GEMM"
Companion: `plans/gemma4-4k-8k-campaign-tracker.md` (prefill TTFT rung campaign)

## Goal

Beat vLLM 0.28 on Gemma-4-12B **realtime** workloads: C1–C4 TTFT *and* TPOT.
Sequencing (fixed): **B0 → A1 → A2+B3 → B1+B2**.

Realtime is dominated by decode, not prefill: at C1/in4096 vLLM spends 170 ms on
TTFT and 1363 ms generating 128 tokens at 10.64 ms/tok. A TTFT win that leaves
TPOT untouched moves ~11% of the request.

## Blocker: no target hardware

The work host is **1× H100 80GB HBM3** (driver 595.91.07, CUDA 13.2). There is no
MI300X, no ROCm runtime, and `perf-data/tools/gpulease` is local-only. The nix
flake can *build* gfx942 objects (TheRock ROCm 7.14) but nothing can execute
them here.

Consequence: **every gfx942 T2/T3/T4 gate in this plan is unrunnable on this
host**, B0 included. Per campaign rule "never transfer a performance result
between architectures", no gfx942 cell may be filled from an H100 run.

Open decision for the owner: retarget this campaign to H100 SM90a (hardware is
present, vLLM reference is measured on the same box), or keep authoring gfx942
code blind and gate it on an MI300X host later.

## Plow recorded, same H100, same model

| Precision | 4K TTFT | 8K TTFT | TPOT |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| BF16 | 221.6 ms | 467.0 ms | **no record** |
| W8A8/FP8 | 164.9 ms | 358.7 ms | **no record** |

Prefill p50, three-seed mean, protocol `g4-4k8k-v1`. At 4K, Plow BF16 is 1.30×
vLLM BF16; Plow FP8 is at rough parity but is a different precision and is not
an apples-to-apples win.

**There is no Plow TPOT or output-tok/s number for 12B anywhere on this branch.**
The realtime goal is currently unmeasured on the Plow side. Closing that is the
prerequisite for every ranking decision below — a fusion priced only against
prefill cannot be ranked for realtime.

## A0 audit — result

Measured, not estimated: `rewrite::fused_sites_for_config` on the exact
checkpoint config, B=1 S=8192.

| Fused kind | Sites | Lowered? | Device opcode | State |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| `FusedNormResidualScaleNorm` | 144 | yes (`NormResidualNorm`) | `DevOp::NormResidualNorm` (23) | covered |
| `FusedNormResidualNorm` | 96 | yes (`NormResidualNorm`) | `DevOp::NormResidualNorm` (23) | covered |
| `SwiGLU` | 96 | **no** | `DevOp::GemmGlu` (20) / `GemvGlu` (19) + fp8 twins | **kernel exists, hand-fused by the emitter** |
| `FusedNormRope` | 80 | **no** | `DevOp::HeadNormRope` (3) / `HeadNormRopeFp8` (37) | **kernel exists, hand-fused by the emitter** |
| `FusedNormLinear` | 4 | **no** | fused `GemvQkv` path | kernel exists |
| `FusedEmbeddingScale` | 1 | **no** | — | unpriced, 1 site |

421 sites, 6 kinds. 240 (57%) lowered; 181 unlowered.

### What this changes about the plan

1. **The kernels already exist.** For Gemma-4-12B every fused kind the rewrite
   finds has a device opcode today. The "28 kinds discovered, 2 lowered" figure
   is a **lowering-table** gap, not a kernel gap, and it counts kinds that
   Gemma-4-12B never produces (Conv3d/GroupNorm/AdaLN/MLA/KDA belong to other
   architectures). No new fused-op kernel needs authoring for this model.

2. **The unlowered bulk is already hand-fused.** `SwiGLU` (96) and
   `FusedNormRope` (80) are 176 of the 181 unlowered sites, and the emitter
   already routes both by hand — `lib.rs:5496` "Prefill fuses too, via the GEMM
   epilogue (`DevOp::GemmGlu`)", and the `HeadNormRope`/NRF decode fold. So the
   unlowered count is **not** a measured loss; lowering them mostly moves an
   existing decision from the emitter into the rewrite table. Price before
   building, per A0's own rule.

3. **A2's named targets do not exist on this model.** `FusedRmsNormSiluGate`,
   `FusedResidualNorm` and `FusedResidual3Norm` produce **zero** sites on
   Gemma-4-12B. Of the two shipped lowerings only `NormResidualNorm` ever fires
   here; `AddNorm` is dead on this model. A2 should be re-scoped to `SwiGLU` +
   `FusedNormRope` or dropped for Gemma.

4. **A1 cannot be driven by the rewrite here.** `FusedLinearAct` /
   `FusedLinearBiasAct` produce zero sites on Gemma-4-12B, so A1 has to be a
   direct emitter decision, not a lowering.

5. **A1's activation is GeGLU, not SiLU.** `dev.rs:116` — "Gemma is GeGLU
   (gelu_tanh), not SwiGLU". The unverified Tensile `activationType` integer to
   settle is the **gelu_tanh** one for this model.

## Workstream status

| Item | State | Evidence / blocker |
|---|---|---|
| Merge `glm53-8k-ttft` | **done** | `044ee494`; 593 + 534 tests pass |
| A0 audit | **done** | table above |
| B0 tile tuning | **blocked** | needs an MI300X; `scripts/rebench_tune_gemm_gfx942.sh` present |
| A1 GEMM epilogue | **ready to author, gate blocked** | premise verified: `amd_gemm_lt.rs:347` `epilogue: [u32; 14]`, only `[9]/[10]` (dstD) written; 12 words zero. Bias-capable specs already pinned (`gemma_lt_bias_gfx942.json` 5, `gemma_lt_nobias_gfx942.json` 3). `activationType` value needs a 1-GPU gfx942 T2 (`scripts/tensile_args.py`) |
| A2 glue fusions | **re-scope** | see finding 3 |
| B3 fused GLU/QKV | **partly already shipped** | `GemmGlu`/`GemvGlu` fuse gate+up+act today |
| B1 skinny GEMM | not started | last by sequencing |
| B2 coverage widening | not started | last by sequencing |
| Plow realtime baseline | **missing, highest priority** | no TPOT/tok-s record for 12B |

## Next actions

1. Resolve the hardware decision above. It gates B0 and every gfx942 gate.
2. Independent of that: record a Plow C1/C4 TTFT+TPOT baseline for 12B against
   the vLLM table, so realtime has a control. Run under `gpulease -n 1`.
3. A1: author the epilogue fields behind `PLOW_GEMM_EPILOGUE_ACT`, defaulted
   off, with the gelu_tanh `activationType` left as the one unresolved constant;
   gate on an MI300X host.

## Protocol

Unchanged from `plans/gemma4-4k-8k-campaign-tracker.md`: one variable per
candidate, `gpulease -n 1` on every GPU run (the box is shared by several
agents), T1 emit byte-identity + checkpoint S, T2 numerics, T3 rung, T4 served,
`perf-certs/<id>.json` before any default flip. No cross-architecture transfer.
